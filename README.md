[How I Learned](https://github.com/LaykinK/LaykinK.github.io/blob/main/How%20I%20Learned.md#how-i-learned)       

This is an excericise in working in GitHub and creating a personal site.

I'm an Information Technology major, working towards a Bachelor of Science degree at University of Missouri-Columbia. This page is part of my Final Project for one of my classes.

### More About Me

I have been working with different languages such as Python, HTML, and JavaScript throughout the past year as part of my program.

I recently switched to the Information Technology program, and I am very excited to learn more languages, more aspects of Software Engineering, as well as gain a certificate for Cyber Security. I'm looking forward to one of my future classes, learning how to make iOS apps, as I could utilize that and other things I will learn on my resume for my career.

I have created many different programs in Python, such as those with user input, those which read and open files, and many more.

*Here is an example of a code I have written*:

**FizzBuzz Challenge**
```markdown
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Fizz Buzz</title>
<script>

function fizzbuzz() {
	var display = document.getElementById('display');
	var displayHTML = "";
	for (i = 1; i < 101; i++) {
		if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0){
			displayHTML += "fizzbuzz" + "<p>";
		}
		else if (i % 3 == 0){
			displayHTML += "fizz" + "<p>";
		} 
		else if (i % 5 == 0) {
			displayHTML += "buzz" + "<p>";
		} 
		else {
			displayHTML += i + "<p>";
		}
	}
	display.innerHTML = displayHTML;
}

</script>

</head>

<body onload = "fizzbuzz()">
<div id="display">

</div>
</body>

</html>
```

### How I Learned

![Python Programming Logo](/Documents/python-programming-launguage.png) ![w3schools Logo](/Documents/w3schools.jpeg) ![CodeAcademy Logo](/Documents/codeacademy.png)

I learned Python through utilizing websites such as [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-to-python-programming/) and [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp), as well as practicing using the code through different challenges and excercises.  I learned JavaScript and HTML trhough using the website [codeacademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html), and also through practicing using excercises and challenges to put the knowledge of the code into practice and see personally how the code functioned and worked.

### How You Can Learn

1. Research different languages to see which one matches what you want to create
   - Different languages have different capabilities and ways that they function, it depends on waht you want to do!
   - Languages have different syntax, and some are more readable than others.
2. Look for websites that can give you tutorials
   - You want to learn the interworkings of the language, the key words, and syntax of what you select.
   - Participate in the excercises available, this gives you practice in working with the code of the program.
   - Give yourself challenges to work towards and create, and try to execute it using your knowledge and finding what you don't already know.
3. Keep working with the language, learning a language, especially a programming language, is like working a muscle, if you don't use it it will stop working as well. You need to use it in order to keep it!
