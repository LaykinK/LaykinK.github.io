## How I Learned

[How You Can Learn](https://github.com/LaykinK/LaykinK.github.io/blob/main/How%20I%20Learned.md#how-you-can-learn)

I learned Python through utilizing websites such as [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-to-python-programming/) and [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp), as well as practicing using the code through different challenges and excercises.  I learned JavaScript and HTML trhough using the website [codeacademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html), and also through practicing using excercises and challenges to put the knowledge of the code into practice and see personally how the code functioned and worked.

Programming can be complicated, especially if you don't know about about the interworkings of the language you are using, and how to use that knowledge to create what you want and what you need to happen to get the code to function in the way that you want. It is very easy to get an error in the code, or something that you need to fix. Whether that is a mispelling, a formatting issue, or a syntax issues, it all means that your program will not function as you intended it to. 

Learning a new language takes dedication and commitment, and a mindset of taking in what you are learning, not just memorizing. It means actually understanding *and* comprehending how everything works and fits together in order to create what you want.

The most basic program is known as the 'hello world' program, it is the most common initial step in programming, known as a proof of concept. To know more: ['hello world' program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program).

**_Hello World program_**:

```
print("Hello, World!")
```

### How You Can Learn

1. Research different languages to see which one matches what you want to create
   - Different languages have different capabilities and ways that they function, it depends on waht you want to do!
   - Languages have different syntax, and some are more readable than others.
2. Look for websites that can give you tutorials
   - You want to learn the interworkings of the language, the key words, and syntax of what you select.
   - Participate in the excercises available, this gives you practice in working with the code of the program.
   - Give yourself challenges to work towards and create, and try to execute it using your knowledge and finding what you don't already know.
3. Keep working with the language. Learning a language, especially a programming language, is like working a muscle, if you don't use it it will stop working. You need to use it in order to keep it!
