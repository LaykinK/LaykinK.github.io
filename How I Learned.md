I learned Python through utilizing websites such as [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-to-python-programming/) and [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp), as well as practicing using the code through different challenges and excercises.  I learned JavaScript and HTML trhough using the website [codeacademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html), and also through practicing using excercises and challenges to put the knowledge of the code into practice and see personally how the code functioned and worked.

### How You Can Learn

1. Research different languages to see which one matches what you want to create
   - Different languages have different capabilities and ways that they function, it depends on waht you want to do!
   - Languages have different syntax, and some are more readable than others.
2. Look for websites that can give you tutorials
   - You want to learn the interworkings of the language, the key words, and syntax of what you select.
   - Participate in the excercises available, this gives you practice in working with the code of the program.
   - Give yourself challenges to work towards and create, and try to execute it using your knowledge and finding what you don't already know.
3. Keep working with the language, learning a language, especially a programming language, is like working a muscle, if you don't use it it will stop working as well. You need to use it in order to keep it!
