**Recursion Turtle Graphics Challenge**

Recursion in computer science is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem (as opposed to iteration). The approach can be applied to many types of problems, and recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science. To know more about recursion: [Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion).

```
#import turtle to make turtle graphics
import turtle

#import everything from turtle
from turtle import *

turtle.colormode(255)

turtle.speed(0)

#outline what to draw
def draw(n, side, angle):

    if n < 0:
        return
    
    right(45)
    forward(side)
    right(angle)

    draw(n-1, side, angle)

for i in range(30):
    turtle.circle(5*i)
    turtle.circle(-5*i)
    turtle.left(i)
    b = i
    if b> 51:
        b = 51
    turtle.color(i, 2*i, 5*i)

#call the function
draw(96, 300, 61)
```

When ran, the program looks like this:

#### Adobe Technical Skills:
- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe Lightroom
- Adobe Premiere Pro
- Adobe InDesign
- Adobe Audition
- Adobe Illustrator

I have created many different projects using AdobeIndesign and Photoshop, the following are examples of things that I have created. The one from InDesign was created for an internship that I am in, it was created to promote a Fire Safety event being hosted by the organization, Central Missouri Community Action (CMCA). The one from Photoshop was created for a final project, it was a collage of many different elements made to look like one continuous image.
