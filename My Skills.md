I have created many different projects using AdobeIndesign and Photoshop, the following are examples of things that I have created. The one from InDesign was created for an internship that I am in, it was created to promote a Fire Safety event being hosted by the organization, Central Missouri Community Action (CMCA). The one from Photoshop was created for a final project, it was a collage of many different elements made to look like one continuous image.
